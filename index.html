					<h3>JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</h3>

          <aside class="notes">
            Today I will tell you about JSON Web Tokens. 
            JWT is the way we can manage users' access in our applications.
            But before we start with JWT itself, let's find out the differences between two things: Authentication & Authorization. 
          </aside>

          <h2>Authentication & Authorization</h2>
          <img height="450" src="https://nordicapis.com/wp-content/uploads/What-is-the-Difference-Between-Authorization-and-Authentication-.png">

          <aside class="notes">
						Authentication and authorization might sound similar, but they are distinct security processes.
						Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.
						Well, let's talk about what is authentication indeed.
						Authentication is the process of identifying users and validating who they claim to be.
						One of the most common and obvious factors to authenticate identity is a password.
						If the user name matches the password credential, it means the identity is valid, and the system grants access to the user.
						Authorization, on the other hand, happens after a userâ€™s identity has been successfully authenticated.
						It is about offering full or partial access rights to resources to get the job done.
						It means every user should have the right to access some information depending on the role.

          <h2>What is JSON Web Token?</h2>
          <p>
            JSON web token (JWT), pronounced "jot", is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
          </p>

          <aside class="notes">
						JSON web token (JWT), pronounced "jot", is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
						It's important to note, JWT is a standard, meaning that all JWTs are tokens, but not all tokens are JWTs.

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is the structure of JWT?</h2>
						<p>JSON Web Token consists of 3 parts seprated by dots:</p>
						<ul>
              <li>Header</li>
              <li>Payload</li>
              <li>Signature</li>
            </ul>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate >
						<h2>Header</h2>
						<p>The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm.</p>
            
            <pre class="fragment fade-up" data-id="code-animation">
              <code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                {
                  "alg": "HS256",
                  "typ": "JWT"
                }
              </code>
            </pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm.
              The most frequently used algorithm, as shown below, is HS256.
              This JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.
            </aside>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Payload</h2>
						<p>The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims that represent additional data.</p>

            <pre class="fragment fade-up" data-id="code-animation">
              <code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                {
                  "sub": "1234567890",
                  "name": "John Doe",
                  "iat": 1457454340,
                  "exp": 1457450740,
                  "admin": false
                }
              </code>
            </pre>

            <p class="r-fit-text fragment fade-right" style="color: #FF2B2B">!Notice that this information is readable by anyone. Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
              "iat" and "exp" fields represent the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (UNIX Epoch) and stand for "Issued At" and "Expires In" respectively.
              The payload is then Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.
            </aside>
					</section>
          <section data-auto-animate>
						<h2>Signature</h2>
						<p>To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.</p>
					
            <img src="assets/signature.png">

            <aside class="notes">
              To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
              The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

            <h2>Access Token</h2>
            <p class="r-fit-text">
							Access token is used to get access to the resource directly.
							They usually have short expiration time.
						</p>

            <img height="450px" src="./assets/access-token.png">

            <aside class="notes">
              There are 2 types of tokens: access token and refresh token.
							Access tokens carry the necessary information to access a resource directly.
							In other words, when a client passes an access token to a server managing a resource, that server can use the information contained in the token to decide whether the client is authorized or not.
							Access tokens usually have an expiration date and are short-lived.

					<section data-auto-animate>
            <h2>Refresh Token</h2>
            <p class="r-fit-text">
							Refresh token provides the opportunity to get a new access token.
							It is used to create new access tokens after old ones have expired, or getting access to a new resource for the first time.
						</p>

            <img height="360px" src="./assets/refresh-token.png">

            <p class="r-fit-text fragment fade-right">
							Access token &#60;=30 minutes, refresh token - up to several months. 
						</p>

            <aside class="notes">
							Refresh tokens carry the information necessary to get a new access token.
							In other words, whenever an access token is required to access a specific resource, a client may use a refresh token to get a new access token issued by the authentication server.
							Common use cases include getting new access tokens after old ones have expired, or getting access to a new resource for the first time.
							Refresh tokens can also expire but are rather long-lived.
							For example, lifetime of an access token is usually &#60;= 30 minutes, refresh token may live up to several months.
							Refresh tokens are usually subject to strict storage requirements to ensure they are not leaked.
							They can also be blacklisted by the authorization server.

						<h2>JWT vs Cookie Sessions</h2>

						<p class="r-fit-text">In Cookie Sessions the server is responsible for the authentication and the client does not know what happens at the server side after sending a request.</p>

						<img height="400px" src="./assets/session-auth.png">

						<aside class="notes">
							Before the emergence of JSON Web Tokens, we predominantly used session-based authentication.
							In this type of authentication method, the server is responsible for the authentication and the client does not know what happens at the server side after sending a request.
							And this is probably the main problem of Cookie Sessions.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<p>Advantages of JWT</p>
						<ul class="r-fit-text">
							<li class="fragment fade-right">There's no need to ask for information in DB on every request.</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-right">Native mobile support of JWT</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-right">Ability to work with microservices.</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="fragment">Disadvantages of JWT</p>
						<ul class="r-fit-text">
							<li class="fragment fade-right">Token can be easily decoded.</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-right">Token is pretty big and works slower than traditional session.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							In case there is a large amount of users accessing our app at once, we will face some server performance issues.
							Nowadays apps should work fine both in browsers and smartphones. And it's more convenient to work with JWTs when you develop mobile apps.
							It's worth noting that in so widely used today microservice architecture using JWTs is the only way to manage access in every service independently.
							When using sessions we should always send request to authentication server which is impossible in microservices.
						
							The main disadvantage of using JSON Web Tokens is the fact that data passed in its header and payload can be easily decoded.
							This means you should never set any sensitive data, such as credentials, password, etc., in token.
							In addition, token contains a large amount of data and works slower in comparison with session.
